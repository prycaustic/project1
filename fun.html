        <p>I don't know what to put on this page so I am just going to talk about a game that I have been playing recently called Resident Evil 4.</p>
        <p>Resident Evil 4 is a survival horror shooter game that was developed by Capcom. It is called RE4, but it is actually the sixth game in the series. The game was released in 2005 for the Nintendo GameCube. </p>
        <p>I have been playing the Steam release version with the RE4 HD fan made textures and the game still looks great! I'm even able to use my PS5 Controller to play it.</p>
        <p>It features the main character Leon S. Kennedy who is on a mission to rescue the president's daughter who has been kidnapped by a cult in a rural European village.</p>
        <p>He looks cool:</p>

        <h1>Reviews</h1>
        <p>The game has a score of 96/100 on Metacritic so clearly everybody loves the game. It is deemed, "one of the best video games ever made." I definitely agree with the reviews and I have been having lots of fun playing it.</p>
        <p>Here is a review of the game from Yahtzee of the Escapist Magazine:</p>
